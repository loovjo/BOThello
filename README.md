# BOThello

## What is this

This is a AI project about an AI simulating a game, and learning the rules, of the board game Othello (also known by the
name Reversi).

## What things are there currently?

Currently, we are still collecting data and making a dataset. The current data can be found in the [dataset](dataset/)
folder. To make data-collecting easier, the [CV](CV/) project is being developed, an semi-automatic way to label an
entire game quickly.
